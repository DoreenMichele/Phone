# Pocket Puter
Project intended to empower people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. 
Born of a discussion on Hacker News: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16726524

There is a website: https://www.pocketputer.com/

And a Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/pocketputer/

I'm not actually a programmer. I don't know how to develop the technical piece suggested to me on Hacker News. "Maybe someday."
